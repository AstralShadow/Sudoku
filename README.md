## How to run

### Android

Or [download the APK from the Releases section](https://github.com/TheSunCat/Sudoku/releases/latest) and install it. It should run with no problems.

### Linux
Run the `sudoku` binary. You may need to mark it as executable first.

### Web
Serve the folder as an HTTP server. I used `simple-http-server` from the AUR, though any should work.

**NOTE**: This app was designed for the mobile form factor. Make sure the window is sufficiently tall and thin to accomodate the game, or it won't look right!

## Building
Clone the repository, run `flutter pub get`, and run one of the following:

- Android: `flutter build apk`
- Linux: `flutter build linux --release`
- Web: `flutter build web`
- iOS and macOS (untested): it's possible, but more complicated. See the Flutter wiki for details.
- Microsoft Windows (untested, unsupported): `flutter build windows`

You will find the build output inside your platform's folder within `./build/`. All contributions are welcome!

## Credits
The design of this app takes inspiration from the excellent [Sudoku - The Clean One](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ee.dustland.android.dustlandsudoku) app available on the Google Play Store. Thanks!
